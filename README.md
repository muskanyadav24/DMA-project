DMA Project – C++ Practice Tasks

This repository contains a set of basic C++ programs focused on Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific use of memory management, pointer operations, arrays, and patterns using dynamic allocation techniques.

📚 Topics Covered
✅ Pointer basics

✅ new and delete operators

✅ Dynamic arrays

✅ Memory management

✅ Simple logic & pattern building
